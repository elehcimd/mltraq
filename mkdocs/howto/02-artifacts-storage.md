# Storing artifacts

## How can I store large objects, including datasets and models?

See the [Data store](../advanced/datastore.md) article for a discussion on how store objects outside the data base.
The `DataStore` and `DataStoreIO` classes help you handle the serialization, I/O operations, transparently or with more control.

!!! Question "Can I use third-party storage services?"
    Yes! If you are interested in more storage options, please create a change request on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/elehcimd/mltraq/issues).
