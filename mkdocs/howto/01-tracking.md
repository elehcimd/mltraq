# Track sequences

## How can I track parameters, time series, metrics and more?

In this experiment, we demonstrate how to track constants, complex objects, as well as rich multidimensional time series.
The sequence tracks also timestamps in the `timestamp` column, omitted to avoid unnecessary changes whenever we updated the docs.
Reloading experiments, access to tracking data and resumed computation is also included.
