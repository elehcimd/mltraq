# Running ML experiments

## IRIS Flowers Classification

In this complete example, we:

1. Load the IRIS dataset in step `load`
2. Instantiate, train and predict with a classifier in step `train_predict`
3. Determine the accuracy score in step `evaluate`

Results are averaged on `10` independent runs with param `seed=range(10)` and multiple classifiers are evaluated thanks to param `classifier=[...]`, for a total of `50` runs.

!!! Success "Congratulations!"
    You can now run ML experiments, persist and share reproducible results with your team.
